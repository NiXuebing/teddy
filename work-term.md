## 学生询问国籍应答
```
If the students want to know your nationality, you should say:
    Sorry, I am not allowed to disclose my nationality, because it is a code in Acadsoc that tutors should be judged by their teaching abilities, 
    but not nationalities, as there were cases where our teachers were discriminated and insulted by a student because of her nationality. 
    All I can confirm with you is that I am currently working in London/New York based company and my working language is British/American/Australia English.

Tutor will receive a warning letter if he/she disclosed the nationality. 
（PS：不透露国籍，不编造国籍，侧重三大主流发音方式）
```

## 提升套路
```
1．I have noticed you have passed the demo lesson and opened classes over one month (begin: Jan. 9), 
    does the DS(direct supervisor) tell you if you have passed the probation period or not?

2．Wait a minute, and I will check it for you. 

3．We have four tutor performance evaluation:

5. No more than 1 complaint

6. No tutor’s cancellation or absence.

7. More than80% booking rate.

8. Student survey report must ≥4.98

I have checked your data, the 1 and 4 requests are perfectly finished, but the other two is not so good. 
I noticed that you have cancelled several classed before, and the most important is the booking rate is a little low. 
It may affect your evaluation result. Now, I will help to prolong your probation period, we will recount your data from Feb. 9, 
but we should make some change, including making it no class cancellation, and especially improving the booking rate. 

I checked your personal Acadsoc account. Your accent is so good, I believe our student will love you so much. 
A little question is that your person profile is very short compare with other teachers. 
If the student doesn’t know you well, they will not prefer to choose your class. So, update it. 
In order to improve our booking rate, I advise to close some unbooked classed, and reduce the classes for one week. 
Are you ok about that?
